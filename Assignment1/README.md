# Assignment 1
This introductory assignment is used to demonstrate the use of class hierarchy within a Java program. A *Shape* super class is instantiated, which contains common shape properties such as surface area and volume, and methods to calculate these properties.

Classes Cone, Cube, and Cylinder, all inherit from the Shape class and present the use of common features of the superclass. The goal is to maintain a strict **is-a** relationship between each class, a very important aspect of OOP

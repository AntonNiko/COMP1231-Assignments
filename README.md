# COMP1231-Assignments
This repository is to present my assignment coursework for TRU-OL COMP1231, a Java-based course on Object-Oriented programming.
These assignemts were graded and came out to a 93% in total.

I attempt to place a focus on *testing* of each component of the program, including some tests which are not including in the original submissions.
These tests serve to test the run-time performance of the programs, and to test the robustness of each class and method by providing a wide range
of inputs.

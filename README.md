# COMP1231-Assignments
This repository is designed to present my assignment coursework for TRU-OL COMP1231, a Java-based course on Object-Oriented programming.
These assignemts were graded and came out to a 93% in total.

I attempt to place a focus on **testing** of each component of the program, including some tests which are not including in the original submissions.
These tests serve to test the run-time performance of the programs, and to test the robustness of each class and method by providing a wide range
of inputs.

## Assignment 1
This introductory assignment is used to demonstrate the use of class hierarchy within a Java program. A *Shape* super class is instantiated, which contains common shape properties such as surface area and volume, and methods to calculate these properties.

Classes Cone, Cube, and Cylinder, all inherit from the Shape class and present the use of common features of the superclass. The goal is to maintain a strict **is-a** relationship between each class, a very important aspect of OOP

## Assignment 2
This assignment focuses on implementing a simple interface that defines a setter/getter method pair for priority-based classes. In this assignment, the *Task* class represents some task on a to-do list, and possesses a priority attribute. The *Priority* interface allows the programmer to implement the setter/getter method to create tasks with different priorities and keep track of the various tasks.

Furthermore, the *java.lang.Comparable* interface is also implemented in *Task* class to demonstrate the usefulness of such interfaces. Its compareTo() method is defined in Task, and allows user to compare the difference in priority between various tasks.
